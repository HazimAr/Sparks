                        Champion athletes aren’t just born - they’re selected, trained, molded and tested. We hone raw talent to maturity with quality coaching, primal workouts and a true love of the sport. Teamwork, perseverance, sportsmanship - those are the hallmarks of Sparks VBC LV / SVBC LV.
                        <br /><br />
                        Sparks Volleyball Club is committed to providing an excellent volleyball experience that promotes hard work, great attitudes, a genuine respect for the game, a “TEAM” concept at all times, and leadership development for each athlete. SVBC will provide the maximum opportunity for each athlete to train and compete at their highest level.
                        <br /><br />
                        No more hoping for the “good coach” or following coaches from club to club.</p>
